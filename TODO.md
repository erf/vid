# TODO

- make use of count
- delete to end of word should delete whole word
- star (*) go to same next word 
- cursor up/down could go to similar render position (not char position)
- better architecture for pending actions ?
- save file without name (requires command mode!)
- repeat last action / search using dot (.)
- better word search ? (e.g. change word is a bit weird now, especiall on eol)
- last line handling
- more tests
