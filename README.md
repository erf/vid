A minimal vi-like text editor for the terminal written in Dart 😎
 
> Note: for fun and learning; not meant to replace your current editor ;)

## Features 📋

- a minimal fast modal vi-like text editor for the terminal 🤓
- correct rendering, editing and cursor movement of emojis ❤️‍🔥
- made for modern terminal emulators (WezTerm<3) using the latest Unicode version (15) 📚
- written in pragmatic Dart code wo dependencies (except the **characters** package) 💻
- unlimited undo ↩️

## Non-goals 🛑

- syntax highlighting (we use terminal bg / fg colors)
- plugins (let's keep things minimal)
- window manager (just open a new terminal tab)
- 100 % vim compatability (only a minimal subset)
- pre-built binaries (build w Dart 3 / install.sh)
