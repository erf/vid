# vid

A minimal vi-like text editor for the terminal written in Dart.

## TODO

- Keep original line endings and don't wrap. Instead move the view as we move alonng the charactes. Edit render lines and when we want to save, just merge all render lines. we can use varius wrap modes in a strict 'view mode' which doesn't allow editing text


## Example text

Emojis 😀😀😀 LOLOLOL this is a line with some weird characters in it ! 😎
