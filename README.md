A minimal vi-like text editor for the terminal written in Dart 😎
 
> Note: For fun and experimentation; not meant to replace your current editor =)

## Features 📋

- a minimal fast modal vi-like text editor for the terminal 🤓
- correct rendering, cursor movement and editing of unicode characters and emojis ❤️‍🔥
- made for modern terminal emulators (WezTerm <3) and the latest Unicode version (15) 📚
- written in pragmatic Dart code 💻

## Non-Goals 🛑

- No syntax highlighting (just terminal colors)
- No plugins (let's not get too fancy)
- No window manager (just open a new Terminal tab)
