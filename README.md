A minimal vi-like text editor for the terminal written in Dart 😎
 
> Note: For fun and experimentation; not meant to replace your current editor =)

## Features 📋

- minimal modal vi-like text editing for the terminal 🤓
- proper rendering, cursor movement and editing of emojis ❤️‍🔥
- use with a modern terminal emulator (WezTerm!) with the latest Unicode version 📚
- written in pragmatic Dart code 💻

## Non-Goals 🛑

- No syntax highlighting (just terminal colors)
- No plugins (let's not get too fancy)
- No window manager (just open a new tab in the terminal)
